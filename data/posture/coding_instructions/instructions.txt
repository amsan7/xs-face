POSTURE/ORIENTATION:

Watch the videos and code the posture from the beginning of the cropped headcam footage. (Variable: Posture) For each coding observation, there are two prompts: type and orientation. Activities are coded in a 2-3 second window, meaning that if a child briefly sits for 1 second and then goes back to standing, it's okay to ignore the sitting. However, if the child is sitting for closer to 2-3 seconds, then that counts.

Types: 
l: lying (on the back)
p: prone (lying on stomach, including crawling)
si: sitting
st: standing (including walking)
c: carrying (child is in parent's arms and clearly off the ground)
xx: not codable - typically this means:
child is out of dv camera view
experimenter's face is in view
child's actions are so sporadic that they aren't code-able 

Orientations (this doesn't apply to the "carry" and "other" types)
0: child is out of reaching distance of the parent
1: child is in reaching distance, parent is in front
2: child is in reaching distance, parent is on left or right side
3: child is in reaching distance, parent is behind them
{leave blank}: if the orientation is c or xx, this does not apply

You are also concurrently going to code if the child is in the frame or not. (Variable: Not-In-Frame) We're doing this to mark which frames will be more subjective, since you'll be looking at the headcam video alone. 

Whenever the child isn't in the frame, mark "NIF" in this column. 

NAMING EVENTS: 

We want to mark all instances naming the study objects; 6 will be in each session (generally: ball, brush, car, tima, manu, zem).
Timestamp should be word onset.
Code only proper names (YES: "zem"; NO: "the yellow one", "it")
If a parent uses the wrong name, code it as the correct one.
