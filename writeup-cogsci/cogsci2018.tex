\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The faces of other people are a critical information source for young
children. During early development, children undergo significant
postural and locomotor development, changing from lying and sitting
infants to toddlers who walk independently. We used a head-mounted
camera in conjunction with a face-detection system to explore the
effects of these changes on children's visual access to their
caregivers' faces during an in-lab play session. In a cross-sectional
sample of 8--16 month old children, we found substantial changes in face
accessibility based on age and posture. These changes may translate into
changes in the accessibility of social information during language
learning. We make our corpus available for reanalysis, and discuss
strengths and limitations of the headcam method more generally.

\end{table}

Our final sample consisted of 36 infants and children, distributed into
each of three age groups: 8 months, 12 months, and 16 months.
Participants were recruited from the surrounding community via state
birth records. Participants had no documented disabilities and were
reported to hear at least 80\% English at home. Demographics and
exclusion rates are given in Table \ref{tab:pop}.

In order to compile this final sample, we tested a substantially larger
group of children, who were excluded for the following reasons: 20 for
technical issues related to the headcam, 15 for failing to wear the
headcam, 10 for fewer than 4 minutes of headcam footage, 5 for having
multiple adults present, 5 for missing CDI data, 2 for missing scene
camera footage, 1 for fussiness, and one excluded for sample symmetry.
All inclusion decisions were made independent of the results of
subsequent analyses. ```
